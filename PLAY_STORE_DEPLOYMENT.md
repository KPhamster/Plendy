### 5. **Privacy Policy (REQUIRED)**

Since your app uses:

- Image sharing and storage
- Social features

You **MUST** have a privacy policy. Key points to cover:
- Data collection (location, images, user profiles)

## üîß **Technical Configuration Status**

### Current Package Configuration:
- **Package Name**: `com.example.plendy` (matches Firebase)
- **Version**: 1.0.0+1
- **Min SDK**: 21 (Android 5.0+)
- **Target SDK**: Latest Flutter target
- **Signing**: Debug signing (needs production signing for updates)

### Firebase Integration:
- ‚úÖ Firebase Auth configured
- ‚úÖ Firebase Firestore configured  
- ‚úÖ Firebase Storage configured
- ‚úÖ Firebase Messaging configured
- ‚úÖ Google Services properly configured

### Permissions Used:
- `INTERNET`: For Firebase services and data sync
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For location-based experiences and maps
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: For location-based experiences
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: For sharing and uploading images

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes for Production**

### 1. **Package Name Consideration**
Currently using `com.example.plendy`. For production, consider:
- Changing to `com.plendy.app` or `com.yourcompany.plendy`
- This requires updating Firebase configuration
- Must be done BEFORE first Play Store upload (can't change after)

### 2. **Production Signing (For Updates)**
Current build uses debug signing. For production updates:
- Uncomment signing configuration in `build.gradle`
- Fix keystore path issue in `key.properties`
- Use production signing for all future updates

### 3. **App Bundle vs APK**
- ‚úÖ Use App Bundle (`.aab`) for Play Store (already built)
- APK is for testing only

## üöÄ **Ready to Deploy!**

Your app is technically ready for Google Play Store submission. The main remaining tasks are:

1. **Create custom app icons** (most urgent)
2. **Write privacy policy** (required)
3. **Take screenshots** for store listing
4. **Set up Google Play Console account**
5. **Upload and submit for review**

The app bundle at `build\app\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab` is ready to upload!
